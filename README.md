Code to build the graphs in the following tutorials:
1. [Visualizing Social Networks for Better Insights: Analyzing and Mapping Social Relationships with Pythonâ€™s NetworkX Library](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-social-networks-for-better-insights-analyzing-and-mapping-social-relationships-with-efeb82ab853e?sk=ba15709c7d136c205bd5fc5b6b8d933c)       
*In Part 1, we explore a special kind of link analysis called Social Network Analysis (SNA). We can conduct Social Network Analysis with Python using the library NetworkX. First, we introduce Python and NetworkX. Then we explore the basics of SNA, such as nodes, edges, and measures of centrality.*

[Visualizing Social Networks for Better Insights: Analyzing and Mapping Social Relationships with Pythonâ€™s NetworkX Library â€” Part 2](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-social-networks-for-better-insights-analyzing-and-mapping-social-relationships-with-f4a9cf6b6d57?sk=872f4b2d55ff92698dc5b5c077011c74)        
*In Part 1, we explored link analysis, specifically social network analysis in investigating and understanding relationships between individuals and entities. Social network analysis (SNA), is a specific type of link analysis that focuses on people and groups and their relationships. We reviewed the basic concepts of SNA, including nodes (representing individuals) and edges (representing connections between individuals). Then, we discussed how SNA can be used to understand social influence, group formation, and information flow using metrics such as degree centrality and betweenness centrality using Billy Corgan and his relationship to the founding members of Smashing Pumpkins as a simple example.*

*At the beginning of our investigation into Billy Corganâ€™s sphere of influence, we introduced social network analysis and basic concepts like nodes and edges. In Part 2, we expanded our understanding of social network analysis by graphing the relationships between the members of the bands Smashing Pumpkins and Zwan. Then, we examined metrics like degree centrality and betweenness centrality to investigate the relationships between the members of the different bands. At the same time, we discussed how domain knowledge helps to inform our understanding of the results.*

*In Part 3, we introduced a third centrality measure, closeness centrality. We also began a discussion on the concept of communities and subgroups and demonstrated different community graphs and how we might use closeness centrality to inform our interpretation. Using the network of musicians who were members of the bands Zwan and Smashing Pumpkins, we made inferences about the relationships between the members.*
